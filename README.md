# 8_Week_SQL_Challenge :muscle:
This repository will keep track of my progress on how I use Microsoft SQL Server to solve case studies from [#8WeekSQLChallenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/) created by [Danny Ma](https://www.datawithdanny.com/).
I want to thank Danny Ma for providing these excellent case studies that have been extremely helpful to me as I learn SQL skills.
