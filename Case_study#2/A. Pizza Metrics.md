### 8. How many pizzas were delivered that had both exclusions and extras?
I provided two outputs, one output shows the results of customers who have become members, and the other one shows the results of all customers.
```sql
--Following is a query that only includes customers who are in the member list

SELECT
  sales.customer_id,
  COUNT(DISTINCT sales.product_id) AS item_count,
  SUM(price) AS total_amount
FROM sales
JOIN menu ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
JOIN members ON sales.customer_id = members.customer_id
WHERE order_date < join_date
GROUP BY sales.customer_id;
```
   ü™Ñ **Output 1:**
   
<img src="images/c1_q8_1.png" width="250">

```sql
--Following is a query that also includes customers who are not in the member list

SELECT
  sales.customer_id,
  COUNT(DISTINCT sales.product_id) AS item_count,
  SUM(price) AS total_amount
FROM sales
JOIN menu ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
LEFT JOIN members ON sales.customer_id = members.customer_id
WHERE order_date < join_date OR join_date IS NULL
GROUP BY sales.customer_id;
```
   ü™Ñ **Output 2:**

### 9. What was the total volume of pizzas ordered for each hour of the day?
```sql
WITH points_cte AS(
  SELECT
    customer_id,
    CASE
      WHEN product_name = 'sushi' THEN price*20
      ELSE price*10
    END AS points
  FROM sales
  JOIN menu ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
  )

SELECT
  customer_id,
  SUM(points) AS total_points
FROM points_cte
GROUP BY customer_id;
```
   ü™Ñ **Output:**

  SELECT
    sales.customer_id,
    CASE
      WHEN product_name = 'sushi' THEN price*20
      WHEN order_date BETWEEN join_date AND DATEADD(day, 6, join_date) THEN price*20
      ELSE price*10
    END AS points
  FROM sales
  JOIN menu ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
  JOIN members ON sales.customer_id = members.customer_id
  WHERE order_date < '2021-02-01'
