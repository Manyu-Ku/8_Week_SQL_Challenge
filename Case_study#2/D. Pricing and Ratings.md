### 1. If a Meat Lovers pizza costs $12 and Vegetarian costs $10 and there were no charges for changes - how much money has Pizza Runner made so far if there are no delivery fees??
```sql
SELECT 
  pizza_id,
  COUNT(pizza_id) order_count,
  CASE 
    WHEN pizza_id = 1 THEN 12
    ELSE 10
  END AS price
INTO #pizza_price
FROM customer_orders c
JOIN runner_orders r ON c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY pizza_id;

SELECT SUM(order_count*price) total_sales
FROM #pizza_price;
```
   ðŸª„ **Output:**

	)

SELECT
